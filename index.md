title: 1st ASMECC Workshop on Autonomic and Self-* Management for the Edge-Cloud Continuum (ASMECC 2023)
---

The **1st ASMECC Workshop on Autonomic and Self-* Management for the Edge-Cloud Continuum (ASMECC 2023)** is co-located with the [4th IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing and Self-Organizing Systems (ACSOS 2023)](https://2023.acsos.org/) that will take place in Toronto, Canada on September 25-29, 2023.

## Call for Papers <!-- ([pdf](assets/cfp-asmecc-2023.pdf)/[txt](assets/cfp-asmecc-2023.txt)) -->


Edge-cloud computing continuum paradigms (e.g. edge, fog, mist computing) enable
distributed and pervasive computing and networking to support a variety of novel ICT-based
applications and services. They represent a deployment target and a management plane for the
software elements (components, microservices, functions) making up modern distributed
applications. The heterogeneity, pervasiveness, dynamism, and interplay with applications, that
characterise the cloud-edge continuum provide significant opportunities and challenges, in
terms of operational flexibility and efficiency. A major challenge lies in supporting the autonomic
management of applications while respecting and opportunistically optimising against the set of
constraints, requirements, and preferences indicated by applications, users, owners, and
providers. Edge-cloud continua have to become intelligent, embedding *cognitive-like* capabilities
for monitoring, reasoning, planning, and acting.

A number of specific issues arise, requiring novel ideas and techniques to be developed. For
instance, how can MAPE-K architectures be adapted to work on the edge-cloud continuum?
How may learning be exploited to refine dynamic deployment policies or anticipate changes?
How can the learned models be explained? What programming models can be used to
adequately express application logic independently of its deployment across the continuum?
What formal specification languages can support architectural descriptions while enabling
analysis of properties of interest? How can the infrastructure self-organise into resilient
structures supporting connectivity and distributed task allocation? How to promote sustainability
and energy/resource-efficiency across the edge-cloud continuum? These are just a few
research questions that may be investigated. But the investigation itself requires tools,
simulators, and benchmarks to conduct experiments in controlled environments without
incurring in the costs of running experiments in real-world settings.
This workshop solicits papers that investigate on the use of autonomic/self-* techniques to
understand, design, and develop solutions on/for the edge-fog-cloud continuum. The topics of
interest include (but are not limited to) the following:

- Algorithms for self-adaptive/self-organising management of applications across the edge-fog-cloud continuum
- Devops solutions for the edge-fog-cloud continuum
- Languages for the specification of deployments, applications, or management policies
- AI techniques for the edge-fog-cloud continuum
- ML techniques for the edge-fog-cloud continuum
- Mathematical methods supporting modelling and algorithmic solutions for the edge-fog-cloud and its management issues
- Soft computing techniques for the edge-fog-cloud continuum
- Self-* techniques for the edge-fog-cloud continuum
- Theories and models at the basis of applications and platforms on the edge-fog-cloud continuum
- Tools or simulators for the edge-fog-cloud continuum
- Edge-cloud computing for the Internet of Things and cyber-physical systems
- Edge-cloud computing for swarm systems

### Submission, review, participation, and publication details

- **Originality**. Submitted papers must be original, unpublished, and not concurrently submitted for publication elsewhere.
- **Kinds of submissions**. Submitted papers should provide original research contributions, and must not exceed **6 pages** (including references; up to two additional pages may be purchased for CR). The workshop welcomes different kinds of research work: theoretical, experimental, review, tool, application. <!-- - **Kinds of submissions**. The workshop welcomes two kinds of submissions:    1. **Workshop papers**: provide original research contributions. These must not exceed **6 pages** (including references; up to two additional pages may be purchased for CR).     2. **Work-in-Progress (WIP) papers**: describe original work-in-progress research which may not have been fully validated. These must not exceed **4 pages** (including references). -->
- **Format**. All paper submissions should follow the [formatting indications of the main conference](https://2023.acsos.org/track/acsos-2023-papers), i.e.,  IEEE 8.5" x 11" Two-Column Format ([IEEE Manuscript Templates for Conference Proceedings](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html)).
- **E-submission site**: <https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=acsos2023> 
    - **NOTE**: upon submission, you have to select the **track "Workshop on Autonomic and Self-* Management for the Edge-Cloud Continuum"**. 
- **Reviews**. Papers will be peer reviewed for originality, relevance to themes, significance, presentation, soundness, and overall quality -- emphasising breadth and relevance to the topics of the workshop. All papers will be reviewed by a TPC with a minimum of 3 reviews per paper. Reviews will be single-blind.
- **Registration and presentation**. At least one of the authors of every accepted paper must register and present the paper at the workshop.
- **Publication and**. All *accepted and presented* papers will be submitted to *IEEE Xplore* and indexing databases like Elsevier, IET, and Scopus.

<!-- 
- **Special issue**. A special issue on an ISI-impacted journal will be organised. A set of high-quality papers from DISCOLI will be invited to submit an extended contribution.
    * Consider submitting your work to the [SI on "Understanding and Engineering Cyber-Physical Collectives" in Frontiers in Robotics and AI (Scimago Ranking: Q2)](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/52323/understanding-and-engineering-cyber-physical-collectives).
